# URL Cleaner

This is a simple applicatiom designed to allow the reading of articles from social media sites like Facebook without having to deal with all the ads and "garbage" on the screen.

**Version:** 1.0

## What it Does

This creates a "Share To" extension in iOS. The user copies the URL to the article they would like to read. Then, they choose the "Share To..." and select "URL Cleaner". The data will be stripped out of the article and an email will be sent with the actual URL for you to read later.

1. Download the Code
2. Open the code in XCode

6. Connect your iPhone to your laptop
7. Turn on Developer Mode if not active.
8. Trust my account as a publisher

## Developer's Note

I realized after a little experimentation that this is basically an attempt at recreating Instapaper. I was not aware of this app at the time but now I am. This app is nowhere near as powerful as Instapaper but might be useful for someone.
